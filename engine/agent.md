## 1. Project Overview

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shared JSON Envelope** | `session/contract.json` — single source of truth for state, decisions, outputs, scoring |
| **State Machine** | 8 forward-flow states + BLOCKED escalation; agents transition through the workflow via the envelope |
| **Scoring Pipeline** | Three-tier scoring after every delegation (rule checks → LLM-as-judge → combined verdict) |
| **Agent Delegation** | Orchestrator delegates to specialized scrum-team agents (product-manager, system-analyst, developer, devops-engineer, quality-analyst, security-engineer, scrum-master, …) |
| **Cross-Model Review** | Reviewers run on a different model than executors; conflicting verdicts → BLOCKED, arbitrated by `council` |
| **Cross-Session Learning** | Lessons, patterns, gotchas persisted via `ctx_knowledge` |

### State Machine Transitions

```
INIT → PLAN → PLAN_SCORED → EXECUTE → EXECUTE_SCORED → REVIEW → REVIEW_SCORED → COMPLETE
                              ↘                ↘                ↘
                          BLOCKED (score < 50 or retry ≥ 3)
                                ↘
                          User intervention → retry with guidance
```

| Transition | Gate | Condition |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| INIT → PLAN | Session created | Always |
| PLAN → PLAN_SCORED | Plan produced | Always |
| PLAN_SCORED → EXECUTE | Plan accepted | Score ≥ 70 |
| EXECUTE → EXECUTE_SCORED | Implementation done | Always |
| EXECUTE_SCORED → REVIEW | Code review | Score ≥ 70 |
| REVIEW → REVIEW_SCORED | Review done | Always |
| REVIEW_SCORED → COMPLETE | All gates pass | Score ≥ 70 |
| Any → BLOCKED | Escalation | Score < 50 or retry ≥ 3 |

### Scoring Pipeline (Three-Tier)

1. **Tier 1 — Rule-Based Checks**: Schema valid (-15), permissions violated (-40), blast radius HIGH (-40), writing order wrong (-15), required fields missing (-15). Subtotal ≥ 70 → Tier 2.
2. **Tier 2 — LLM-as-Judge**: Scores 0-100 on requirements fulfillment (0-40), governance compliance (0-30), completeness (0-20), edge cases (0-10).
3. **Tier 3 — Combined Verdict**: PASS (≥70), RETRY (50-69, max 3 attempts), BLOCKED (<50).

### Architecture

```
agents/     → 16 agent instruction files (orchestrator, product-manager, scrum-master, developer, devops-engineer, quality-analyst, security-engineer, …)
skills/     → 64 skill directories (system-analyst, writing-plans, spec-driven-development, …)
contract/   → contract.template.json, contract.schema.json, state.template.md
rules/      → rules.json (state machine transitions, scoring thresholds, cross-model review)
doc/        → workflow guides, project.md, gap analysis, reports
usage/      → 4 tool usage guides (lean-ctx, graphify, context7, opencode)
```

## 2. Framework Architecture

### Deployment Layout

The engine ships inside the container image (`COPY engine/ /opt/engine/`) and is exposed to OpenCode through symlinks in the config directory. Agents read it at `/opt/engine/`:

```
~/.config/opencode/
   ├── opencode.json → (bind-mounted) config/opencode.json
   ├── agent.md   → /opt/engine/agent.md      (instructions[0])
   ├── /opt/engine/agents/    → /opt/engine/agents/        16 agent instruction files
   ├── /opt/engine/skills/    → /opt/engine/skills/        64 skill directories
   ├── /opt/engine/rules/     → /opt/engine/rules/         rules.json (state machine)
   ├── /opt/engine/contract/  → /opt/engine/contract/      contract.template.json, contract.schema.json, state.template.md
   ├── /opt/engine/usage/     → /opt/engine/usage/         4 tool usage guides
   └── /opt/engine/doc/       → /opt/engine/doc/           workflow guides, reports
```

Engine changes take effect on container rebuild; the bind-mounted config on restart.

### Directory Tree

The `engine/` source mirrors the runtime layout — edit here, rebuild to deploy:

```
├── agent.md           ← THIS FILE (instructions[0])
├── AGENTS.md          ← lean-ctx code intelligence (loaded at session start)
├── README.md          ← Project overview (diagram, badges)
├── /opt/engine/agents/            ← 16 agent instruction files
├── /opt/engine/doc/               ← Workflow guides, project.md, reports
├── /opt/engine/rules/             ← rules.json (state machine, scoring, cross-model review)
├── /opt/engine/skills/            ← 64 skill directories
├── /opt/engine/contract/          ← contract.template.json, contract.schema.json, state.template.md
├── /opt/engine/usage/             ← 4 tool usage guides
└── /opt/engine/scripts/           ← Automation & validation scripts
```

## 5. Development Workflow

### Session Model

Work is tracked in a single `session/` directory — no git branches required.

- All contract state lives in `session/contract.json`; snapshots are archived in `session/`.
- The engine is repository-agnostic — never block on branch or VCS checks.
- Every session is self-contained and resumable from `session/`.

### Before Any Edit

```
1. ctx_read / ctx_compose — understand the code first
2. ctx_impact({target: "symbol", direction: "upstream"})   # blast radius
3. If HIGH/CRITICAL → warn user before proceeding
```


Run this ladder in order before writing ANY code:

```
1. Does this need to exist?       → skip it (YAGNI)
2. Standard library does it?      → use it
3. Native platform feature?       → use it
4. Already-installed dependency?  → use it
5. Can this be one line?          → one line
6. Only then: minimum code that works
```


**Not sacrificed:** Input validation at trust boundaries, data-loss error handling, security, accessibility, anything explicitly requested. Non-trivial logic leaves ONE runnable check (assert-based, no framework).

### Orchestration Flow (Scrum Team — Spec-Driven Development)

1. **Refine phase** — Delegate to @product-manager: capture intent, write Given-When-Then acceptance criteria, declare scope + non-goals. Attach user-journey or story-map diagrams via diagram-design when intent spans multiple actors.
2. **Discuss phase** — 5-lens check: Business, System, Dev, QA, DevOps. Clarify requirements.
3. **Plan phase** — Delegate to @system-analyst: impact analysis, edge cases, implementation plan. @software-architect reviews the plan (independent model). Plans spanning >3 files or crossing services include an architecture/impact diagram (diagram-design).
4. **Spec gate** (if >3 files, cross-service, or >30 min) — Write GWT-format specs. Cross-examine via DDD.
5. **Execute phase** — Delegate to @developer: implement plan step by step, write tests alongside code. @devops-engineer owns pipeline/deploy/migration. @fixer for scoped fixes. UI tasks load design-taste-frontend; developer passes the impeccable detector before marking UI work done (EXECUTE exit gate).
6. **Review phase** — Delegate to @quality-analyst (5-axis) AND @security-engineer (security) on the **reviewer model**, independent from the executor. Conflicting verdicts → BLOCKED, arbitrated by @council. UI diffs get the impeccable design-lens (slop detector) inside the readability axis.
7. **Process gate** — @scrum-master audits transitions, enforces gates, and owns the Definition of Done before COMPLETE. Unblocks BLOCKED sessions.
8. **Verify loop** — Run build commands, check conventions.
9. **Ship** — Resolve issues, confirm deploy safety, run post-flight protocol; @learner captures lessons.

### UI/UX Pipeline (Mandatory)

All UI work runs the 4-layer pipeline in this order — enforced by @design-orchestrator:

| # | Layer | Skill | Role |
|---|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Exemplar | `design-exemplar` | Copy a proven look from the 84-brand DESIGN.md library (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, …) when a reference brand is named |
| 2 | Generator | `ui-ux-pro-max` | BM25-search a fitting design system (styles, palettes, fonts, patterns) for the user's own product |
| 3 | Taste | `design-taste-frontend` | Art direction pass — kill generic "AI-slop" patterns, enforce gallery-grade composition |
| 4 | Gate | `impeccable` | No UI task is done without an impeccable design-lens review |

Layer selection: user names a reference brand → Exemplar; user describes their own product → Generator; neither → Generator; trivial tweak (<10 lines, no new components) → pipeline may be skipped, impeccable gate still applies.

Rules: order is mandatory; never mix Exemplar + Generator for the same page; DESIGN.md (page) / MASTER.md (global) persistence per ui-ux-pro-max `--persist`.

Use **Doubt-Driven Development (DDD)** when uncertain: spawn a fresh-context adversarial reviewer to cross-examine non-trivial decisions before they stand.

### Before Commit (Post-Flight Protocol)

| # | Step | Tool |
|---|------|------|
| **0** | Validate contract | `bash /opt/engine/scripts/validate-contract.sh --file session/contract.json --score` |
| 1 | Impact verify | `ctx_impact` |
| 2 | Change detect | `ctx_delta` |
| 3 | Knowledge persist | `lean-ctx ctx_knowledge remember` |
| 4 | Graphify sync | `lean-ctx ctx_shell` `bash graphify --update` |
| 5 | STATE.md | `ctx_edit` |
| 6 | Session save (complete) | See **Save Session Protocol** below

**Pre-flight**: `bash /opt/engine/scripts/validate-contract.sh --file session/contract.json --score` (score < 70 = BLOCKED)
**Parallel conflict check**: `bash /opt/engine/scripts/detect-parallel-conflicts.sh --file1 /tmp/a.txt --file2 /tmp/b.txt`
**Atomic persist**: `bash /opt/engine/scripts/persist-contract.sh --file session/contract.json --inject-score 85` |

Exceptions: docs-only changes skip 1, 2, 4. Config-only skip 1, 2.

### Save Session Protocol

When the user says "save session" or a phase completes, save to **ALL** systems:

```bash
# 1. Persist orchestration envelope to lean-ctx knowledge
lean-ctx ctx_knowledge remember key orchestration-contract value "<JSON>"

# 2. Update session/state.md — append completed work items

# 3. Archive snapshot to session/ (contract files + state log + index)
bash /opt/engine/scripts/snapshot-contract.sh --snapshot-only

# 4. Save conversation context (survives OpenCode restart)
lean-ctx ctx_session save

# 5. Re-index Graphify knowledge graph (if graphify-out/ exists)
graphify --update 2>/dev/null || true
```

**One-shot alias**: `save session` = all 5 steps above. Always run the full protocol — partial saves lose audit trail, break resumption, or leave stale indexes.

### Update All States

After major changes (merged work or resumed sessions), synchronize all state systems:

```bash
# 1. Re-index Graphify knowledge graph
graphify --update 2>/dev/null || true

# 3. Snapshot contract state (session/ → archive)
bash /opt/engine/scripts/snapshot-contract.sh

# 4. Save conversation context (survives OpenCode restart)
lean-ctx ctx_session save
```


### Session Lifecycle Protocol

Every orchestration session persists contract state to the `session/` directory for cross-session traceability and safe resumption.

#### Directory Layout

```
session/
├── contract.json         ← Live orchestration contract (single source of truth)
├── contract.schema.json  ← Schema for the contract
├── state.md              ← Append-only chronological state log
└── archive/              ← Timestamped snapshots (audit trail)
```

#### Lifecycle Protocol

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **State transition** | Update `session/contract.json` → snapshot via `/opt/engine/scripts/snapshot-contract.sh` |
| **Session end** (COMPLETE/BLOCKED) | Final snapshot → append summary to `session/state.md` |
| **New session** | Re-scaffold `session/contract.json` from `/opt/engine/contract/contract.template.json` |

#### Snapshot Command Reference

```bash
scripts/snapshot-contract.sh                # Full snapshot: copy files + update state.md
scripts/snapshot-contract.sh --snapshot-only  # Copy files only (skip state.md updates)
scripts/snapshot-contract.sh --summary "State: ${STATE} — description"  # Custom entry
scripts/snapshot-contract.sh --dry-run --verbose  # Preview without changes
```

#### Why It Matters

The `session/` archive preserves:
- **Audit trail**: `session/state.md` grows monotonically — every state transition, every decision, every blocker
- **Safe resume**: `session/contract.json` is the exact state from last session — no reconstruction needed

### Complex Tasks (Orchestration Template)

See [orchestration-template skill](/opt/engine/skills/orchestration-template/SKILL.md) and [`/opt/engine/doc/workflow.md`](/opt/engine/doc/workflow.md) for the full orchestration protocol.

## 6. Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Never commit secrets, credentials, tokens, `.env` files**

### Cross-Model Review
- **Reviewers must run on a different model than the executor** they audit — executor `opencode/big-pickle` vs reviewer `sumopod/deepseek-flash`
- **Conflicting reviewer verdicts** (PASS vs BLOCK) → `BLOCKED`, arbitrated by `@council` (see `rules.json → enforcement.cross_model_review`)
- **Security-sensitive changes** (auth, secrets, credentials, config, crypto) auto-require `@security-engineer` review

### Code Safety
- **Never edit without `ctx_impact`** — run impact analysis first
- **Never commit without `ctx_delta`** — verify scope
- **Never rename with find-and-replace** — use `ctx_refactor`
- **Ignore HIGH/CRITICAL impact warnings** = governance violation

### Shell Safety
- **Always use `lean-ctx ctx_shell`** — never `bash` or `snip` (both denied in permissions)
- `bash` and `snip` trigger permission prompts and block automation

### Communication
- Explain tradeoffs, not just decisions
- Admit unknowns. Be token-efficient: concise, no filler, no full-file dumps
- Return only what was asked

# lean-ctx — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by lean-ctx as **workflow-state-engine** (1675 symbols, 1666 relationships, 0 execution flows). Use the lean-ctx MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `bash graphify --update` from the project root.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the previous snapshot..
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
